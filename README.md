# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
We wanted to help Louise better plan for future Kickstarter campaigns by finding out when is the best time of year to have
a successful theater campaign as well as the optimal goal setting for play campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
---We can see that starting a campaign in May has the highest chance of becoming successful because the difference between
---success and failure/cancelation is the greatest. On the flip side, December is the most difficult month to ensure a
---successful campaign seen by the close data points. Fortunately for Louise, *every* month still gives her favorable odds
---to run a successful theater campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
---Campaigns for plays are more consistently successful when the goal is below $20,000. Although the success rate is favorable
---at some higher goals, the sample size is simply too small to confidently back the data up.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
---As mentioned before, a larger sample size of play campaigns with goals greater than $20,000 would give more confidence of an
---accurate representation. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
---Louise should continue to start theater campaigns during the summer months (preferably in May) and avoid starting too many
---in the dead of winter. Not only are her successful margins slimmer then, but she's more likely to cancel some during the
---turn of the new year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
---Louise needs to stick to goals that are less that $20k to give her the best chance for success. If the total number of
---campaigns in the larger goal ranges was similar to those below $20k, it could prove that $35k-45k is also a healthy goal
---range. However, the sample size doesn't compare and proves to be volatile.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
---I would have liked to use a 100% Stacked Bar graph for the Outcomes Based on Launch Date which would better shown the
---difference in successful and failed/canceled campaigns, because the actual count doesn't matter as much as the likelihood of
---each outcome. Even a bar graph showing the percentage of successful campaigns per month would have worked.
