# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
We wanted to help Louise better plan for future Kickstarter campaigns by finding out when is the best time of year to have
a successful theater campaign as well as the optimal goal setting for play campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We can see that starting a campaign in May has the highest chance of becoming successful because the difference between
success and failure/cancelation is the greatest. On the flip side, December is the most difficult month to ensure a
successful campaign seen by the close data points. Fortunately for Louise, *every* month still gives her favorable odds
to run a successful theater campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns for plays are more consistently successful when the goal is below $20,000. Although the success rate is favorable
at some higher goals, the sample size is simply too small to confidently back the data up.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
As mentioned before, a larger sample size of play campaigns with goals greater than $20,000 would give more confidence of an
accurate representation. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Louise should continue to start theater campaigns during the summer months (preferably in May) and avoid starting too many
in the dead of winter. Not only are her successful margins slimmer then, but she's more likely to cancel some during the
turn of the new year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Louise needs to stick to goals that are less that $20k to give her the best chance for success. If the total number of
campaigns in the larger goal ranges was similar to those below $20k, it could prove that $35k-45k is also a healthy goal
range. However, the sample size doesn't compare and proves to be volatile.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would have liked to use a 100% Stacked Bar graph for the Outcomes Based on Launch Date which would better shown the
difference in successful and failed/canceled campaigns, because the actual count doesn't matter as much as the likelihood of
each outcome. Even a bar graph showing the percentage of successful campaigns per month would have worked.
